A pretty straightforward JSPM and Gulp-powered static site template, using BrowserSync, Autoprefixer, SASS and Preprocess.

# Getting started

You'll need Gulp and JSPM to get the beast running, along with a couple of Node packages.

1. Install Gulp (Run `npm install gulp -g`)
2. Install JSPM (Run `npm install jspm -g`)
3. Initialise JPSM with `jspm install`
4. Get the development node packages with `npm install`

# Fire it up

Run `gulp`. Celebrate.
